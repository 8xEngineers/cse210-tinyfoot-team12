# 8xEngineers

We are a group of enthusiastic students from University of California San Diego interested in building better and efficient software. In the current age, software has grown unfathomably and is an integral part of our lives. Every day, we are surrounded by numerous applications, tools, and services without which our lives would be unimaginable. However, with this unfathomable growth, the importance of designing and building _efficient, sustainable, and scalable_ software has taken a backseat. Many systems today suffer from the lack of maintenance and documentation, poorly designed code and incompatability issues. 

Addressing these issues, we aim to build better software by following best practices, using the latest technologies, and collaborating with like-minded individuals. As students of CSE210 (Software Engineering) under professor [Thomas Powell](https://classes.pint.com) at UCSD, we are learning the fundamentals of software engineering and are excited to apply our knowledge to real-world problems.
