# Tinyfoot

With the recent plugins, the way we perceive footnotes has changed. Footnotes have become this non-intrusive way to  add extra information to a text without breaking the flow. They are no longer relegated to the bottom of  the page, but instead, they are displayed inline, allowing the reader to quickly access the additional information.

With Tinyfoot, we take this idea forward by adding many more customization features to allow users to create  the perfect footnote experience for their content. Imagination is the limit!

Building from the success of Littlefoot, we have added these key features to enhance the user experience:
- **Highlights** -  Add a highlight to the footnote text to make it stand out.
- **Click-and-drag** - Move the pop-over to anywhere on the page.
- **Copy-button** - A simple yet useful feature to  copy the footnote text.

With many more features in the pipeline, we are excited to see how users will utilize Tinyfoot to create engaging content.
