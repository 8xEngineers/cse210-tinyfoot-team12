# Warm-Up Retrospective

## Team Challenges:
- In the bigfoot part, understanding and modification of the large coffee script file was challenging, as it is not a familiar language.
- In the littlefoot part, all of them had issues in understanding javascript, cypress and css as they had zero experience of frontend.
- There was a difficulty in handling the outdated dependencies and libraries which caused some compatability issues.
- There were scheduling conflicts among the group to accomodate everyone's time preferances and the mode of meeting.
- The workflow to manage the build process for setting up the environment for running the bigfoot was also challenging.
- Some of them were new to git so they had problem in branching and merging which resulted in push to main.
