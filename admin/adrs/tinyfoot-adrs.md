# Adding highlight feature to footnote

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to offer a feature that allows users to mark specific footnotes as important. This way, after closing the footnotes, users can easily return to the highlighted ones without having to click through each footnote to find the specific one they need.
The key design decision we need to make here is determining the best placement for this feature. We need to decide where and how users will interact with the option to highlight important footnotes for easy access later.

## Considered Options

* Add a button in the popup window
* Double click on the footnote button

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Add a button in the popup window

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### Double click on the footnote button

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Double click on the footnote button", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->
